<h1>Account & Access Management</h1>

<p>
This page provides general information on how users may manage their connection, access settings, 
and any app-related permissions associated with their Facebook account.

<h2>Managing App Access Through Facebook</h2>

can do so directly from their Facebook account settings. 
Removing an app from Facebook will revoke its permissions and disconnect it from the user’s profile.

  <li>Go to <strong>Settings & Privacy → Settings</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Apps and Websites</strong>.</li>
  <li>Locate the app you want to manage.</li>
  <li>Choose <strong>Remove</strong> if you want to terminate access.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Direct Contact</h2>

they may contact the service administrator at the following email:
